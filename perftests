# Doc to track performance tests 

PERF TEST SCENARIOS
---------------------
Baseline scenario 1:  run kafka-consumer-perf-test.sh and kafka-producer-perf-test.sh WITHOUT TLS
Scenario 1A: producer only  (based on custoemr response to 3. below)
Scenario 1B: consumer only
Baseline scenario 2:  run kafka-consumer-perf-test.sh and kafka-producer-perf-test.sh WITH TLS
Need to evolve these to see if we need more than single threaded scenarios



Pre-reqs/ Customer clarifications
---------------------------------
1. Get sample message from the customer? What is the size of the message?(do we need large msg settings?)
2. How do they intend to run the perf test? timebound? # of messages sent and received?
3. Do they want to test writes and reads or either?
4. Will the publisher specify what partition to write to? K check kafka-producer-perf-test.sh
5. Does teh customer want to do 'single thread' only? 
6. Make sure we have one consumer per partition
7. 



Items to tune (K to redo the order? and reorder by what to do in producer, consumer and broker):
---------------------------------------
-Replication factor? ie replicas per partition 
- Replication: sync vs async
-OS Page cache? or too early for that?
-# The number of threads doing disk I/O
num.io.threads=8

-# The send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) used by the socket server
socket.send.buffer.bytes=1048576

-# The receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) used by the socket server
socket.receive.buffer.bytes=1048576
-# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.
log.segment.bytes=536870912

-queue.buffering.max.ms (for setting how long to wait before sending to broker, good for throughput not latency)
-Consumer: replica.high.watermark.checkpoint.ms . (to let know what offset was last consumed)
-Producer: batch size
-Producer: linger.ms



Other considerations for being comparable to AWS MSK
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Networks hops between producer, broker, consumer comparable?
