# To track performance tests 

Baseline scenario 1:  run kafka-consumer-perf-test.sh and kafka-producer-perf-test.sh WITHOUT TLS
Scenario 1A: producer only  (based on custoemr response to 3. below)
Scenario 1B: consumer only
Baseline scenario 2:  run kafka-consumer-perf-test.sh and kafka-producer-perf-test.sh WITH TLS
Need to evolve these to see if we need more than single threaded scenarios



Pre-reqs:
1. Get sample message from the customer
2. How do they intend to run the perf test? timebound? # of messages sent and received?
3. Do they want to test writes and reads or either?
4. Will the publisher specify what partition to write to? K check kafka-producer-perf-test.sh
5. Does teh customer want to do 'single thread' only? 



Items to tune (K to redo the order?):
1. Replication factor? ie replicas per partition 
2. Replication: sync vs async
3. OS Page cache? or too early for that?
